# XR Teleport Controls

Bezier Curve teleport controls based on the "Tall Raycast" model from [Oculus' Teleport Curves](https://developer.oculus.com/blog/teleport-curves-with-the-gear-vr-controller/) documentation.

[Demo here](https://gkjohnson.github.io/webxr-sandbox/teleport-controls/)!

## Possible Improvements

- Provide an override to perform the raycast manually given the derived vector.
- Provide a flag to disable automatically jumping to the next spot.
- Add ability to quickly interpolate to the target location.
- Add ability to use joy sticks to turn.
- Pick curve generation control point such that it always arcs in the correct direction.
