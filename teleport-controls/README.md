# XR Teleport Controls

Bezier Curve teleport controls based on the "Tall Raycast" model from [Oculus' Teleport Curves](https://developer.oculus.com/blog/teleport-curves-with-the-gear-vr-controller/) documentation.

## Possible Improvements

- [ ] Provide an override to perform the raycast manually given the derived vector.
- [ ] Provide a flag to disable automatically jumping to the next spot.
