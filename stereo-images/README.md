# Stereo Image Rendering

Shader for rendering stereo image pairs on a plane. Stereo images from [lockhaven.edu](https://www.lockhaven.edu/~dsimanek/3d/stereo/3dgallery22.htm).

## TODO

- Write a shader that renders a different half of a stereo pair image per eye.
- Position plane in space with ability to squeeze trigger to position plane next to the controller.
- Move plane forward and back and larger and smaller with joystick.
