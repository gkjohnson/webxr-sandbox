# XR Gamepad

Helper for initializing and visualizing and XR Gamepad and forwarding button presses.

[Demo here](https://gkjohnson.github.io/webxr-sandbox/xr-gamepads/)!

NOTE: In Chrome the gamepad handles do not seem to dynamically update and they must be polled via navigator.getGamepads(). Firefox updates the gamepads as expected.

## TODO

- Docs
- Use remote debugging to find out what the controller buttons enumerate to on Mozilla Reality.
